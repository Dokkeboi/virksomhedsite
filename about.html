            Funk is what you don’t play! The band understand that funk is not
            just about the notes played but the spaces left between them—these
            pauses breathe life into their music, making each performance
            vibrantly alive.

            Since their first show, Out Of Season have worked hard to give their

            special moments on stage, and funky tricks are key to making their
            shows special. The band do everything they can to make sure every
